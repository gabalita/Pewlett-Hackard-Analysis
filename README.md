**Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?**
- Since retirement-ready people are 30% of the existing workforce, there are plenty of opportunities for these folks to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. 

**Future Queries and Metrics to Consider**
1. _Percentage of Baby Boomber Employees Within Each Department._ This metric will allow management to understand if there are certain departments that have a higher percentage of baby boomers in their cohort. Thus, these departments might have to invest more in mentorship programs. 
2. _Percentage of Baby Boomer Employees Within Each Position_. This metric will tell us if there are certain positions that need to be replaced more. For example, there are only 2 managers that will be replaced, but there are thousands of engineer and staff positions. The company needs to ensure that there is enough leftover workforce to replace these positions.
